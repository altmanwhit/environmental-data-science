## About Me

I'm an environmental data scientist at an environmental consulting firm with an unusual background:

- **M.A.T. Middle Grades Science** — former K–12 teacher; I explain things for a living

- **M.S. Environmental Science & Engineering** — hydrogeology, contaminant transport, site characterization, fractured bedrock

- **M.S. Data Science** — machine learning, statistical analysis, data engineering

This repository documents my self-guided learning program to master the tools that will genuinely transform environmental consulting: cloud databases, applied ML, LLM-powered automation, and production-grade MLOps.

**Every project here connects to a real problem I'm solving at work.**

## 🎯 Core Projects (Real Work, Anonymized)

### ESG Database (Azure SQL)
Building a production SQL database in Azure to manage ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) data for environmental consulting clients. Covers schema design, ETL pipelines via Azure Data Factory, and automated reporting hooks.

### AI-Powered Report Generator
Using LLMs (LangChain + Azure OpenAI) to standardize and automate environmental reporting — turning structured database outputs into client-ready narrative reports.

### Environmental Monitoring ML Pipeline
Time series forecasting and anomaly detection on groundwater monitoring data. Replaces manual trend analysis with reproducible, auditable ML models.
